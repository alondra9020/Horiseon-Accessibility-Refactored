# Horiseon Accessibility Refactored Code

Marketing agency Horiseon wanted their codebase to follow accessibility standards in order to help optimize their site for search engines. I tooks their original code and refactored it to meet the current accessibility standards by fixing broken links, adding appropriate semantics and consolidating CSS styles. 
[The optimized site can be accessed here.](https://alondra9020.github.io/Horiseon-Accessibility-Refactored-Code/)

### Header

Upon landing on the deployed site we find well organized header with working links to the services Horiseon provides. The header has been refactored to follow the appropriate HTML sematics and the header styles have been condensed to make a more efficient CSS file. A separate section was also created for the site's hero image.

A section called "Services" was created to house the content of the three services listed on the Horiseon site in order to follow proper semantics and efficient styling. Descriptions were also added to each of the images in this section to facilitate interactions with accessibility readers.
