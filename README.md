# Horiseon-Accessibility-Refactored

Marketing agency Horiseon wanted their codebase to follow accessibility standards in order to help optimize their site for search engines. I tooks their original code and refactored it to meet the current accessibility standards by fixing broken links, adding semantics to the HTML file and consolidating CSS styles.
